## Deployment
Check us out on
[PythonAnywhere](https://fence.pythonanywhere.com/ChandlrWheelr).

## Name
The internal working name of our project is *ChandlrWheelr*.

By the nature of this project, it is clear that our development team can
be very indecisive at times. It is reflected in the fact that we could
not come to a consensus on what the project name would be. In light of
this, we have decided to create a list of
[proposed names](docs/names.md) and use the product to determine the
final name as a demonstration during the final project proposal.

## Project Proposal
The original proposal for this project can be found
[here](docs/proposal.md).

## Scrum board

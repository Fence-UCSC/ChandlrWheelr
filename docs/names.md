# Name Proposals

By the nature of this project, it is clear that our development team can
be very indecisive at times. It is reflected in the fact that we could
not come to a consensus on what the project name would be. In light of
this, we decided to create a list of proposed names (shown below) and
use the product to determine the final name as a demonstration during
the final project proposal.

The original name on the [proposal](proposal.md) was *Master Plan*, our
working name was *ChandlrWheelr*, and the final name
[selected](https://fence.pythonanywhere.com/ThirdWheel/wheel/6) by our
algorithm is *Third Wheel*.
